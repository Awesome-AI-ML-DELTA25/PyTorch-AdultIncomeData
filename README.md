# To Do
- Create a conda environment to store the packages
- Export the data that you cleaned in the previous project (you can use your own cleaned data or someone else's) as a CSV file
- Use PyTorch to create a neural network of your choice to perform a regression task
- Train the model on the data you exported
- Use different python files to separate the different parts of your code
- Choose good hyperparameters
- Ensure best practices
- Report proper metrics, along with graph showing training and test loss with epochs
- Work solo or in pairs
- Ensure that your code is well commented
- Create a README file to explain your project, your process, and your findings
- Make sure to include the following in your README:
  - A description of the project
  - The data you used
  - The model you created
  - The results you obtained
- Make sure to not commit __pycache__ files
- Create a requirements.txt file to document the packages you used
- Create a .gitignore file to ignore the data files
- Create a branch for your project on this repository

The best project will be merged into the main branch for showcase! Good luck!
